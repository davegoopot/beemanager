Tools for managing bee hives


## Camera

An initial objective is to set up a system that will take pictures of the entrance of a bee hive at
regular intervals. The pictures will be used to monitor the activity of the hive. The pictures should
be accessible remotely from a mobile device.

### Initial Camera Experiment

As an initial experiment, I will set up a Raspberry Pi with a camera to take pictures on a regular
schedule using cron. The pictures will be stored on the Raspberry Pi and only accessible with SSH
access to the Pi.
